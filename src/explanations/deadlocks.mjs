        'Such a situation hinders the process model to terminate successfully. As a consequence, it may happen ' +
        'that such a process model leads to unexpected situations in practice (tasks that are not finished, objectives ' +
        'that are not reached, and so on).</p>');
    panel.append('<p>A best practice is that each process model should have the <strong>option to complete</strong>, ' +
        'a <strong>proper termination</strong>, and <strong>no dead tasks</strong>. All these best practices ' +
        'are violated by a deadlock.</p>');
    panel.append('<p>Research has shown that typical deadlocks occur in <em>diverging parallel gateways</em> or in ' +
        ' two or more <em>diverging inclusive gateways</em> waiting for the execution of each other. ' +
        'A deadlock in a diverging parallel gateway is caused if at least one but not all incoming sequence flows ' +
        'of the gateway get a token. Each diverging parallel gateway requires a (implicit) <em>triggering</em> converging ' +
        'parallel gateway on all paths to its incoming sequence flows, which guarantees the execution of the gateway ' +
        'when a control flow reaches one of its incoming flows. Otherwise, it is <em>not</em> guaranteed that the ' +
        'gateway is executed - it may block locally and causes a deadlock.' +
